In Bayesian inference, we consider inference conditional on the observed data, and treat the parameter as random. This can be understood as reflecting our uncertainty about the value that generated the data from the model. To achieve this, the likelihood of the random sample $\\boldsymbol{Y}$ is combined with prior distributions for the model parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = (\\theta_1,\\ldots,\\theta_m)^\\top \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$, with prior density  $p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$; we use the generic notation $p(\\ldots)$ for various conditional and unconditional densities and mass functions. \n\nThe posterior distribution,\n$$\n p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\boldsymbol{Y}) = \\frac{p(\\boldsymbol{Y} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\theta})p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})}{ \\int p(\\boldsymbol{Y} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\theta})p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\theta}},\n$$ {#eq-bayes}\n is proportional, as a function of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, to the product of the likelihood and the priors in the numerator, but the integral appearing in the denominator of @eq-bayes is untractable in general.  In such cases, the posterior density  $p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\boldsymbol{Y})$ usually does not correspond to any well-known distribution family, and posterior inferences about the components of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ further involve marginalizing out the other components. \n \n \n For instance, to obtain the posterior density $p(\\theta_1\\mid \\boldsymbol{Y})$ of the first parameter in $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, we have to evaluate the $(m-1)$-dimensional integral $\\int p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\boldsymbol{Y})\\,\\mathrm{d}(\\theta_2,\\ldots,\\theta_m)$. If we have posterior draws from $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, this amounts to picking out only entries that correspond to the particular parameter of interest, e.g., $\\theta_1$. \n \n \nMost of the field of Bayesian statistics revolves around the creation of algorithms that circumvent the calculation of the normalizing constant (or else provide accurate numerical approximation of the latter) or that allow for marginalizing out all parameters except for one.\n \n \nWe first consider priors for the model parameters of extreme value distributions. These should reflect the range of plausible values and can sometimes interpreted be interpreted as penalties: for example, normal parameters in mixed models shrink values towards the overall mean or slope vectors. The more concentrated the prior mode is, the more influence the prior has. Bernstein-von Mises theorem however guarantees that, as the sample size grows, the influence of the prior is washed away unless the prior imposes restrictions on the support $\\Theta$. For example, if we take a Beta prior $\\xi \\sim \\mathsf{Be}(a,b)$ prior on $[-0.5, 0.5]$, then the posterior for $\\xi$ will be restricted to this range and shrunk towards the prior mean.\n\nSuppose we fit a generalized extreme value distribution as before. The `revdbayes` package specifies a range of prior functions, see `?revdbayes::set_prior`. It is possible to set priors for, e.g., the quantile spacing, and then map them back to the GEV parameters $\\mu, \\sigma, \\xi$.\n\n```{r}\n#| message: false\nlibrary(revdbayes)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndata(\"frwind\", package = \"mev\")\nlyon <- with(frwind,\n             xts::xts(x = S2, order.by = date))\n# Create series of yearly maximum\nymax <- as.numeric(xts::apply.yearly(lyon, max))\n# Fit a model with a trivariate normal prior for mu, log(sigma), xi\nprior1 <- set_prior(prior = \"mdi\", model = \"gev\")\nprior2 <- set_prior(prior = \"beta\", model = \"gev\")\nprior3 <- set_prior(prior = \"norm\", \n                model = \"gev\", \n                mean = c(mean(ymax), log(sd(ymax)), 0), \n                cov = diag(c(1000, 1000, 1)))\n```\n\nHaving specified our prior distributions, we can use software to obtain draws from the posterior.
