The difficulty now is that there are more parameters to estimate and the support restriction translates into up to $n$ inequality constraints, as they must be supported for every combination of covariates found in the database. These two facts mean numerical optimization is more difficult.\n\nIn models with a relatively large number of parameters, it is useful to  include additive penalty terms to the log likelihood: for example, generalized additive models for the parameters include smooth functions, typically splines, with a penalty that controls the wiggliness of the estimated predictor functions. The latter is typically evaluated using the second-order derivative of the basis functions. \n\nFor example, consider a function of covariates $f(x_j) = \\sum_{k=1}^K \\beta_k b_k(x_j)$, where $b_k(\\cdot)$ is a basis function, possibly with compact support. We then consider penalties that penalize the squared second derivative of the function $f(x)$. Since the regression coefficients $\\beta$'s are constants, the penalty can be expressed in terms of the second derivative of the basis functions concatenated in a smooth matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ with $(i,j)$th entry $S_{ij} = \\int b_i''(x) b_j''(x)\\mathrm{d} x$, so the penalty can be written $\\lambda \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\top \\mathbf{S}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ for some tuning parameter $\\lambda \\geq 0$ that controls the tuning. The penalty can be viewed in the Bayesian paradigm as an improper Gaussian prior. The optimal value of $\\lambda$ for smoothing is selected by maximizing the marginal likelihood: in high-dimensional settings, or why we include interactions, optimization of this is far from trivial.\n\nThe `mgcv` package in **R** allows for estimation of generalized additive models using the methods described above. There are multiple choice of basis functions that can be used, including the default thin-plate spline `tp`, cubic splines `cs` and cubic cyclic splines `cc` for cyclic covariates such as period of year.\nWhile most software for generalized additive models will allow for The smooths consisting of linear combination of basis functions\n\nIn nonstationary models, risk measures of interest are defined conditionally on the value of covariates: for example, the $1-p$ conditional return level is [@Eastoe.Tawn:2009]\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(Y_t  > y \\mid \\mathbf{X}_t =\\boldsymbol{x}_t) = p\n\\end{align*}\nand the corresponding unconditional return level,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_{\\mathcal{X}} \\Pr(Y_t  > y \\mid \\mathbf{X}_t =\\boldsymbol{x}_t) \\mathrm{d} P(\\boldsymbol{x}_t),\n\\end{align*}\n is obtained by averaging out over the distribution of covariates that are employed in the model.
