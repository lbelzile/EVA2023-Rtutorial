The focus of the first part of the workshop will be on univariate extremes, including likelihood-based, Bayesian and nonparametric methods for both peaks-over-threshold and block maxima approaches, with a foray into nonstationary extremes. The second part of the workshop will concentrate on conditional extremes and time series.\n\nThe tutorial takes place Friday, June 30th, 2023, from 14:00 until 18:15. \n\n# Course content\n\nUnivariate extremes: \n\n- [Likelihood-based modelling](slides/EVA2023-Rsoftware-likelihood.html)\n- Threshold selection for peaks over threshold\n- Semiparametric methods\n- Bayesian inference\n- Nonstationary extremes\n\nMultivariate extremes and time series:\n\n- Conditional extremes model\n- Time series\n\n\n# Instructions\n\nWe will be using multiple **R** packages from the Comprehensive R Archive Network, as well as development versions of some packages.\n\nIf you plan on using your own laptop, download and install [**R** (current version 4.3.0, nicknamed \"Already Tomorrow\")](https://cran.r-project.org/) and an integrated development environment such as [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndevpkgs <- c(\"lbelzile/mev\", \"lbelzile/rbm\")\ncranpkgs <- c(\"lite\", \"revdbayes\", \"texmex\",\n              \"threshr\", \"tea\", \"evt0\", \"remotes\",\n              \"xts\", \"lubridate\", \"ggplot2\")\ninstall.packages(cranpkgs)\nremotes::install_github(devpkgs)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Instructors\n\n- [Thomas Opitz](https://biosp.mathnum.inrae.fr/homepage-thomas-opitz), INRAE\n- [Léo Belzile](https://lbelzile.bitbucket.io), HEC Montréal\n\n",
