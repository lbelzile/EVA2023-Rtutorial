However, `mev` does not handle generalized linear or generalized additive models for the parameters, to avoid having as many inequality constraints in the optimization as there are observations times the number of covariates.\n\n## Basic theory\n\nLet $\\ell(\\boldsymbol{y}; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ denotes the log-likelihood of an $n$ sample with a $p$-dimensional parameter $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$. The score vector is $\\ell_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\partial \\ell / \\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, while the Fisher information is $i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\mathrm{E}\\{\\ell_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\ell_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})^\\top\\}$. Under regularity conditions, we also have $i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = - \\mathrm{E}(\\partial^2 \\ell / \\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^\\top)$. The observed information is the negative Hessian $\\jmath(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})-\\partial^2 \\ell / \\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^\\top$, evaluated at the maximum likelihood estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$. \n\n\nBy definition, the maximum likelihood estimator solves the score equation, i.e. $\\ell_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})=\\boldsymbol{0}_p$. If the maximum likelihood estimator is not available in  closed-form, its solution is found numerically and this property can be used to verify that the optimization routine has converged or for gradient-based maximization algorithms. \n\n### Likelihoods\n\nThere are four basic likelihoods for univariate extremes: the likelihood of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution for block maxima, the likelihood for the generalized Pareto distribution and that of the non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) for exceedances above a threshold $u$ and lastly the likelihood of the $r$-largest observations. \n\n### Generalized extreme value distribution\n\nThe generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution with location parameter $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$, scale parameter $\\sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$ and shape\nparameter $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$  is \n \\begin{align*}\n  G(x)  = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\exp\\left\\{-\\left(1+\\xi \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^{-1/\\xi}\\right\\}, &  \\xi \\neq 0,\\\\\n\\exp \\left\\{ -\\exp \\left(-\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)\\right\\},&  \\xi = 0,\n\\end{cases} \n \\end{align*}\ndefined on $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}: \\xi(x-\\mu)/\\sigma > -1\\}$ where $x_{+} = \\max\\{0, x\\}$. The case $\\xi=0$ is commonly known as the Gumbel \ndistribution. \nWe denote the distribution by $\\mathsf{GEV}(\\mu, \\sigma, \\xi)$. \n\nThe max-stability property allows one to extrapolate the distribution beyond observed levels: one can show that the distribution of the maximum of a larger block (or $N$ block maximum) would be also generalized extreme value if $Y_i \\sim \\mathsf{GEV}(\\mu, \\sigma, \\xi)$ are independent, where $\\max_{i=1}^N Y_i \\sim \\mathsf{GEV}(\\mu_N, \\sigma_N, \\xi)$ and  $\\mu_N = \\mu + \\sigma(N^\\xi-1)/\\xi$ and $\\sigma_N = \\sigma N^\\xi, \\xi_N = \\xi)$ --- the case $\\xi=0$ is defined by continuity. In practice, we can partition data into $m$ blocks of roughly equal size $n/m$ and fit a GEV distribution to the maximum of the blocks.\n\nThis distribution is suitable for maximum of a large number of observations: the larger the block size, the closer the approximation will be, but the smaller the sample size $m$. The `fit.gev` function includes two optimization routines: either use the PORT methods from `nlminb`, or Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm (`BFGS`) inside a constrained optimization algorithm (augmented Lagrangian). The default option is `nlminb`, which sometimes returns diagnostics indicating false convergence when the model is near the maximum likelihood estimate.\n\nAs for other model, parameters can be fixed and nested models can be compared using the `anova` S3 method. For these, we distinguish between estimated coefficients (`estimate`) or with the `coef` method, and the full vector of parameters, `param`.\n\n\n### Generalized Pareto distribution\n\nThe generalized Pareto (GP) distribution with scale $\\sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$ and shape $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is \n \\begin{align*}\n  G(x)  = \n\\begin{cases}\n1-\\left(1+\\xi \\frac{x}{\\sigma}\\right)_{+}^{-1/\\xi}, &  \\xi \\neq 0,\\\\ 1-\n\\exp \\left(-\\frac{x}{\\sigma}\\right),&  \\xi = 0.\n\\end{cases}\n \\end{align*}\nThe range of the generalized Pareto distribution is $[0, -\\sigma/\\xi)$ if $\\xi < 0$ and is $\\mathbb{R}_{+}$ otherwise. We denote the distribution \nby $\\mathsf{GP}(\\sigma, \\xi)$. \nThe default optimization algorithm for this model is that of @Grimshaw:1993, which reduces the dimension of the optimization through profiling. The exponential distribution and the case $\\xi=-1$ are handled separately. If the sample coefficient of variation is less than one, the global maximum lies on the boundary of the parameter space since there exists for any $\\xi<-1$ a value $\\sigma^*$ such that $\\ell(\\sigma^*, \\xi) \\to \\infty$: the search is thus restricted to $\\xi \\geq -1$. These cases are more frequent in small samples due to the negative bias of the maximum likelihood estimator of the shape.\n\nExcept for this boundary case, the maximum likelihood estimator solves the score equation $\\partial \\ell(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) / \\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta} = \\boldsymbol{0}_2$. We can thus check convergence by verifying that the score vanishes at the maximum likelihood estimate.\n\nIf $\\widehat{\\xi} < -0.5$, the asymptotic regime is nonstandard [@Smith:1985] and the standard errors obtained from the inverse information matrix are unreliable; as such, `mev` does not report them and prints an optional warning. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(mev)\nset.seed(1234)\ndat <- evd::rgpd(n = 10, shape = -0.8)\nfitted <- fit.gpd(dat, threshold = 0, show = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nMethod: Grimshaw \nLog-likelihood: NaN \n\nThreshold: 0 \nNumber Above: 10 \nProportion Above: 1 \n\nEstimates\nscale  shape  \n 1.22  -1.00  \n\nStandard Errors\nscale  shape  \n   NA     NA  \n\nOptimization Information\n  Convergence: successful \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Empirical coefficient of variation\n# Theoretical quantity defined as standard deviation/mean\nsd(dat)/mean(dat)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.6094863\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" fig.caption='Profile log likelihood of the generalized Pareto distribution' hash='likelihood_cache/html/gpprofile_1c25aa3010207356943d11f3ff89872f'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](likelihood_files/figure-html/gpprofile-1.png){fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe figure shows the profile likelihood for $\\eta = -\\xi/\\sigma$ for two datasets, one of which (leftmost) achieves its maximum at $\\widehat{\\xi} = -1$ and $\\widehat{\\eta} = 1/\\max(\\boldsymbol{y})$.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" fig.caption='Diagnostic plot for fitted model, with pointwise 0.95 confidence intervals from order statistics'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Another example where the solution lies inside the parameter space\ndat <- evd::rgpd(n = 25, shape = 0.2)\nfitted <- fit.gpd(dat, threshold = 0, show = FALSE)\n# Check convergence - is gradient zero?\nisTRUE(all.equal(gpd.score(par = coef(fitted), dat = dat),\n                 rep(0, 2)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Various methods are available\nmethods(class = \"mev_gpd\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] anova  coef   logLik nobs   plot   print  vcov  \nsee '?methods' for accessing help and source code\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# P-P and Q-Q diagnostic plots \npar(mfrow = c(1, 2))\nplot(fitted)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](likelihood_files/figure-html/gp2-1.png){fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Fit exponential by passing a list with a fixed parameter\nreduced <- fit.gpd(dat, threshold = 0, fpar = list(shape = 0))\n# The MLE is sample mean of exceedances - check this\nisTRUE(coef(reduced) == mean(dat))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Compare models using likelihood ratio test\nanova(fitted, reduced)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nAnalysis of Deviance Table\n\n        npar Deviance Df  Chisq Pr(>Chisq)\nfitted     2   50.439                     \nreduced    1   52.893  1 2.4534     0.1173\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `mev` package includes alternative routines for estimation, including the optimal bias-robust estimator of @Dupuis:1999 and the approximate Bayesian estimators of @Zhang.Stephens:2009 and @Zhang:2010.

The likelihood of the limiting distribution of the point process for the $r$-largest observations is, for $\\mu,\\xi\\in\\mathbb{R}, \\sigma>0$,  \\[\n\\ell(\\mu,\\sigma,\\xi; \\boldsymbol{y}) \\equiv  -r\\log(\\sigma) - \\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\xi}\\right)\\sum_{j=1}^r \\log\\left(1 + \\xi\\frac{y_{(j)}-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)_{+} - \\left(1 + \\xi\\frac{y_{(r)}-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^{-1/\\xi}_+.\n\\]\nThis likelihood can be used to model the $r$-largest observations per block or threshold exceedances where the threshold is the $r$th order statistic \n \nConsider a sample of $N$ observations, of which $n_u$ exceed $u$ and which we denote by $y_1, \\ldots, y_{n_u}$. The likelihood associated to the limiting distribution of threshold exceedances is, for $\\mu, \\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\sigma >0$, \n\\begin{align}\nL(\\mu, \\sigma, \\xi; \\boldsymbol{y}) = \\exp \\left[ - c \\left\\{1+ \\xi \\left( \\frac{u-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)\\right\\}^{-1/\\xi}_{+}\\right] (c\\sigma)^{-n_u}\\prod_{i=1}^{n_u} \\left\\{1+\\xi\\left( \\frac{y_i-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)\\right\\}^{-1/\\xi-1}_{+},\\label{eq:ppp_lik}\n\\end{align}\nwhere $(\\cdot)_{+} = \\max\\{0, \\cdot\\}$. The quantity $c$ is a tuning parameter whose role is described in \\S 7.5 of @Coles:2001. If we take $c=N/m$, the parameters of the point process likelihood correspond to those of the generalized extreme value distribution fitted to blocks of size $m$. The NHPP likelihood includes a contribution for the fraction of points that exceeds the threshold, whereas the generalized Pareto is a conditional distribution, whose third parameter is the normalizing constant $\\zeta_u=\\Pr(Y>u)$. Since the latter has a Bernoulli and $\\zeta_u$ is orthogonal to the pair $(\\sigma, \\xi)$, it is often omitted from further analyses and estimated as the proportion of samples above the threshold.\n\nThe model includes additional arguments, `np`  and `npp` (number of observations per period). If data are recorded on a daily basis, using a value of `npp = 365.25` yields location and scale parameters that correspond to those of the generalized extreme value distribution fitted to block maxima. Alternatively, one can specify instead the number of periods `np`, akin to $n_y$ in Eq. 7.8 of @Coles:2001 --- only the latter is used by the function, with `npp*np` theoretically equal to the number of exceedances. \n\nThe tuning parameters impact the convergence of the estimation since the dependence between parameters becomes very strong: @Sharkey:2017 suggest to pick a value of `np` that near-orthogonalize the parameters. Wadsworth:2011 recommended picking this to be the number of observations (so `npp=1`), but @Moins:2023 show that a better choice leads to orthogonalization. \n\nAnother option is to fit the generalized Pareto model: if the probability of exceeding threshold $u$ is small, the Poisson approximation to binomial distribution implies\n\\[c \\left\\{1+ \\xi \\left( \\frac{u-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)\\right\\}^{-1/\\xi} \\approx n_u, \\]\nwhere $n_u$ is the number of threshold exceedances above $u$ and $c$ is the tuning parameter `np`. With the point estimates of the generalized Pareto model, say $(\\widehat{\\sigma}_u, \\widehat{\\xi})$, we thus use \n\\begin{align*}\n\\mu_0 &= u - \\sigma_0\\{(n_u/c)^{-\\widehat{\\xi}}-1\\}/\\widehat{\\xi},\\\\\n\\sigma_0 &= \\widehat{\\sigma}_u\\times (n_u/c)^{\\widehat{\\xi}},\n\\end{align*}\nand $\\xi_0=\\widehat{\\xi}$ as starting values. Most of the time, these values are so close to the solution of the score equation that numerical convergence of the optimization routine is all but guaranteed in a few likelihood evaluations. If no starting value is provided and some fixed parameters are provided, the model will approximate the distribution of the vector of parameters by a multivariate Gaussian distribution and compute the best linear predictor of the remaining parameters given those are fixed. This method works well if the log-likelihood is near quadratic and the values are not too far from the maximum, but does not deal with the boundary constraints. In case these starting values are invalid, and an error message is returned.\n\nThe log likelihood of the $r$ largest order statistics likelihood is derived from the inhomogenenous Poisson point process formulation. We normally consider a matrix of observations $m \\times r$ containing the largest $r$ order statistics of each block out of the $n$ sample. The parameters of the $r$-largest likelihood are the same as the generalized extreme value distribution (a special case when $r=1$). This model can be used when we have access to order statistics, assuming that the observations within the block are independent. \n\n\\begin{multline}\n\\ell(\\mu,\\sigma,\\xi; \\bs{y}) = -rm\\log(\\sigma) - \\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\xi}\\right)\\sum_{i=1}^m\\sum_{j=1}^r \\log\\left(1 + \\xi\\frac{y_{i,(j)}-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)_{+} \\\\ - \\left(1 + \\xi\\frac{y_{i,(r)}-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^{-1/\\xi}_+, \\quad \\mu,\\xi\\in\\mathbb{R}, \\sigma>0. \\label{eq:rlarglik}\n\\end{multline}\nIt's not obvious how to chose $r$, but @Belzile:2022 shows the gain from considering larger values of $r$ decreases and the support constraints, typically arising for the minimum observation, means that finding good starting values is hard.\n\nWe can simulate from the $r$ largest observations by drawing from a unit rate Poisson process $0<U_1<U_2<\\cdots$, where $U_j=E_1+\\cdots+E_j$ and $E_j\\sim \\mathsf{Exp}(1)$, and setting $Y_{j} = \\mu + \\sigma\\big(U_j^{-1/\\xi}-1\\big)/\\xi$. Applying the inverse transformation $\\Lambda_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(y) = \\left\\{ 1 + \\xi(y-\\mu)/\\sigma\\right\\}^{-1/\\xi}_+$ evaluated at the MLE gives roughly independent exponential spacings, which can be used to create quantile-quantile plots.\n\n## Risk measures\n\nTwo  typical questions in extreme values are: given the intensity of an extreme event, what is its recurrence period? and what is a typical worst-case scenario over a given period of time?  For the latter, suppose for simplicity that the daily observations are blocked into years, so that inference is based on $N$ points for the $N$ years during which the data were recorded. The *return level* is a quantile of the underlying distribution corresponding to an event of probability $p=1-1/T$ for an annual maximum, which is interpreted as ``the level exceeded by an annual maximum on average every $T$ years''.  If observations are independent and identically distributed, then we can approximate the probability that a return level is  exceeded $l$ times over a $T$ year period using a binomial distribution with probability of success $1-1/T$ and $T$ trials. For $T$ large, the return level is exceeded $l=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$ times within any $T$-years period with approximate probabilities 36.8\\%, 36.8\\%, 18.4\\%, 6.1\\% and 1.5\\%. The probability that the maximum observation over $T$ years is exceeded with a given probability is readily obtained from the distribution of the $T$-year maximum, leading [@Cox:2002, \\S3(b)] to advocate its use over return levels, among other quantities of interest such as the number of times a threshold $u$ will be exceeded in $T$ years or the average number of years before a threshold $u$ is exceeded.\n\n**Quantiles, mean and return levels of $T$-maxima**: consider the distribution $H(x) = G^T(x)$ of the maximum of $T$ independent and identically distributed  generalized extreme value variates with parameters $(\\mu, \\sigma, \\xi)$ and distribution function $G$. By max-stability, the parameters of  $H(x)$  are $\\mu_T=\\mu-\\sigma(1-T^\\xi)/\\xi$ and $\\sigma_T=\\sigma T^\\xi$ when $\\xi \\neq 0$. We denote the expectation of the $T$-observation maximum by $\\mathfrak{e}_T$, the $p$ quantile of the $T$-observation maximum  by $\\mathfrak{q}_p = H^{-1}(p)$  and the associated return level by $z_{1/T} =  G^{-1}(1-1/T)$. Then, any of these three quantities can be written as\n\\begin{align*}\n \\begin{cases}\n \\mu-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\xi}\\left\\{1-\\kappa_{\\xi}\\right\\}, &  \\xi <1, \\xi \\neq 0, \\\\\n \\mu+\\sigma\\kappa_0, &  \\xi =0,\n  \\end{cases}\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\kappa_{\\xi}=T^\\xi\\Gamma(1-\\xi)$ for $\\mathfrak{e}_T$, $\\kappa_{\\xi}=T^\\xi\\log(1/p)^{-\\xi}$ for $\\mathfrak{q}_p$ and $\\kappa_{\\xi}=\\left\\{-\\log\\left(1-{1}/{T}\\right)\\right\\}^{-\\xi}$ for $z_{1/T}$.  In the Gumbel case, we have $\\kappa_0=\\log(T)+\\gamma_{e}$ for $\\mathfrak{e}_T$, $\\kappa_0=\\log(T)-\\log\\{-\\log(p)\\}$ for $\\mathfrak{q}_p$ and $\\kappa_0=-\\log\\{-\\log(1-1/T)\\}$  for $z_{1/T}$.  \n\n\n\n## Statistical inference\n\nThis section presents some test statistics that can easily be computed using some of the functionalities of `mev`, as well as confidence intervals for parameters and common functionals, based on the profile likelihood.\n\nThe three main type of test statistics for likelihood-based inference are the Wald, score and likelihood ratio tests. \nThe three main classes of statistics for testing a simple null hypothesis $\\mathscr{H}_0: \n\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0$ against the alternative $\\mathscr{H}_a: \\boldsymbol{\\theta} \n\\neq \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0$ are the likelihood ratio, the score and the Wald statistics, \ndefined \nrespectively as \n\\begin{align*}\n w &= 2 \\left\\{ \\ell(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})-\\ell(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0)\\right\\},\\qquad \n \\\\w_{\\mathsf{score}} &= U^\\top(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0)i^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0)U(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0),\\qquad\n \\\\ w_{\\mathsf{wald}} &= (\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}-\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0)^\\top i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0)(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}-\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0),\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ is the maximum likelihood estimate under the alternative and \n$\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0$ is the null value of the parameter vector. The statistics $w, w_{\\mathsf{score}}, w_{\\mathsf{wald}}$ are all first order equivalent and asymptotically follow a $\\chi^2_p$ distribution, where $q$ is the difference between $p$ and the number of parameters under the null hypothesis. Under the conditions of the Neyman--Pearson theorem, the likelihood ratio test is most powerful test of the lot. The score statistic $w_{\\mathsf{score}}$ only  requires \ncalculation of the score and information under \n$\\mathscr{H}_0$, which can be useful in problems where calculations under the alternative are difficult to obtain. The Wald statistic $w_{\\mathsf{wald}}$ is not parametrization-invariant and typically has poor coverage properties.\n\nOftentimes, we are interested in a functional of the parameter vector $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$.\nThe profile \nlikelihood $\\ell_\\mathsf{p}$, a function of $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}$ alone, is obtained by maximizing the \nlikelihood pointwise at each fixed value $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}=\\boldsymbol{\\psi}_0$ over the nuisance vector \n$\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\psi_0}$, \n\\begin{align*}\n   \\ell_\\mathsf{p}(\\boldsymbol{\\psi})=\\max_{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}\\ell(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda})=\\ell(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\psi}}).\n\\end{align*}\nWe denote the restricted maximum likelihood estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_\\psi= (\\psi, \\hat{\\lambda}_{\\psi})$. \n\n\nWe can define score and information in the usual fashion: for example, the observed profile information function is \n\\[j_\\mathsf{p}(\\boldsymbol{\\psi})\n=-\\frac{\\partial \\ell_\\mathsf{p}(\\boldsymbol{\\psi})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\psi}\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\psi}^\\top} \n= \\left\\{j^{\\boldsymbol{\\psi\\psi}}(\\boldsymbol{\\psi}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\psi}})\\right\\}^{-1}.\n\\]\n\nWe can turn tests and their asymptotic distribution into confidence intervals. For the hypothesis $\\psi = \\psi_0$, a $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval based on the profile likelihood ratio test is $\\{ \\psi: 2\\{\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) - \\ell(\\hat{\\theta}_{\\psi})\\} \\leq  \\chi^2_1(0.95)\\}$.\n\n\n\n## Numerical example  \n\nThis example illustrates some of the functions used in peaks-over-threshold analysis based on fitting a generalized Pareto distribution to threshold exceedances.

The method has theoretical convergence guaranteesfor convergence. Because of non-regularity, the maximum likelihood estimator for $\\xi < -1$ does not solve the score equation and leads to infinite log-likelihood, hence the maximum returned lies on the boundary of the parameter space. The standard errors are based on the inverse observed information matrix and provided only if $\\xi>-1/2$. We can verify that our maximum likelihood estimate is indeed a maximum by checking if it solves the score equation  if $\\hat{\\xi}>-1$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nisTRUE(all.equal(\n  gpd.score(gpdf$estimate, dat = gpdf$exceedances),\n  c(0,0), tolerance = 1e-5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf the sample is small, maximum likelihood estimators are biased for the generalized Pareto distribution (the shape parameter is negatively biased, regardless of the true value for $\\xi$). Bias correction methods includes the modified score of Firth, but the default method is the  implicit correction (`subtract`), which solves the \nimplicit equation \n\\begin{align}\n   \\boldsymbol{\\tilde{\\theta}}=\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}-\\boldsymbol{b}(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}). \\label{eq:implbias}\n\\end{align}\nThe point estimate $\\boldsymbol{\\tilde{\\theta}}$ is obtained numerically as the root of this nonlinear system of \nequations. In the present case, the sample size is large and hence the first-order correction, derived through asymptotic arguments from the generalized Pareto distribution likelihood, is small. Note that the bias correction requires $\\xi > -1/3$, since it is based on third-order cumulants of the distribution.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngpdbcor <- gpd.bcor(dat = gpdf$exceedances, par = gpdf$estimate)\n#print the differences between MLE and bias-corrected estimates\ngpdf$estimate - gpdbcor\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     scale      shape \n 0.1915284 -0.0118876 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe package includes some default diagnostic plots (probability-probability plots and quantile-quantile plots), which include approximate confidence intervals based on order statistics. We can also get profile likelihood and profile-based confidence intervals for most quantities of interest (parameters of the generalized Pareto distribution, excepted shortfall, return levels, $N$-observation maxima mean and quantiles). \n\n## Exercice\n\n1. Simulate 200 observations from the $r$-largest likelihood using `rrlarg` with shape parameter $\\xi=-0.2$ and $r=5$.\n2. Test the hypothesis $\\mathscr{H}_0: \\xi = \\xi_0$ using a score test and derive a 90% confidence interval for $\\xi$. You can obtain the maximum likelihood estimator by calling `fit.rlarg` and the score and information matrix are implemented under `rlarg.score` and `rlarg.infomat`. Recall that the score statistic $w_{\\mathsf{score}} \\equiv U(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{\\xi_0})^\\top i^{-1}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{\\xi_0})U( \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{\\xi_0}) \\sim \\chi^2_1.$ \n\n## References\n",
