# Description

This satellite workshop will review **R** implementations of a variety of techniques for statistical analysis of extreme values. The focus of the first part of the workshop will be on univariate extremes, including likelihood-based, Bayesian and nonparametric methods for both peaks-over-threshold and block maxima approaches, with a foray into nonstationary extremes. The second part of the workshop will concentrate on conditional extremes and time series.

The tutorial takes place Friday, June 30th, 2023, from 14:00 until 18:15 in room Aula Info AS04.

# Instructions

We will be using multiple **R** packages from the Comprehensive R Archive Network, as well as development versions of some packages.

If you plan on using your own laptop, download and install [**R** (current version `r version$major`.`r version$minor`, nicknamed "`r version$nickname`")](https://cran.r-project.org/) and an integrated development environment such as [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
