# Description

This satellite workshop will review **R** implementations of a variety of techniques for statistical analysis of extreme values. The focus of the first part of the workshop will be on univariate extremes, including likelihood-based, Bayesian and nonparametric methods for both peaks-over-threshold and block maxima approaches, with a foray into nonstationary extremes. The second part of the workshop will concentrate on conditional extremes and time series.

The tutorial takes place Friday, June 30th, 2023, from 14:00 until 18:15 in room Aula Info AS04.

# Instructions

We will be using multiple **R** packages from the Comprehensive R Archive Network, as well as development versions of some packages.

If you plan on using your own laptop, download and install [**R** (current version `r version$major`.`r version$minor`, nicknamed "`r version$nickname`")](https://cran.r-project.org/) and an integrated development environment such as [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
devpkgs <- c("lbelzile/mev", "lbelzile/rbm")
cranpkgs <- c("lite", "revdbayes", "texmex", "POT", 
              "coda", "gridExtra", "patchwork",
              "GGally", "extRemes", "evd", "extremogram", 
              "threshr", "tea", "evt0", "remotes",
              "xts", "lubridate", "ggplot2", "exdex")
install.packages(cranpkgs)
remotes::install_github(devpkgs)
```

You may need to download the [**R** tool chain](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/), the [`clang` and `gfortran` on Mac](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/) to build packages.

If you cannot download the package `mev`, use the CRAN version via `install.packages("mev")` and download the data from [here](https://github.com/lbelzile/mev/raw/b153a69044622f7155b3abe71f02a5716565a3de/data/frwind.rda).
