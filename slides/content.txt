## Maximum likelihood estimation

- Example application from vignette (Venice sea level data using 2-largest with trend vs GEV, threshold exceedances with Eskdalemuir data)
- Extremal type theorem and alternative representations
- Key likelihood equations and equivalence: generalized Pareto vs inhomogeneous Poisson process + return levels
- Support constraints and gradient algorithms
- Score equation and information matrix
- Convergence issues in small samples
- Sampling distribution and bias
- Computing quantities of interest: return levels and interpretation, etc.
- Reparametrizing the model: orthogonality and optimisation 
- Don't code the likelihood yourself!
- Incorrectly implementations and reasons for this
- Don't fix the shape (incorrect uncertainty quantification)




## Bayesian inference

- Bayes theorem and change of paradigm
- Priors for extreme value distributions
- 'revdbayes' with binomial - GP model
- Diagnostics for MCMC
- Posterior samples and return levels
- Example from EVA2023 data competition with loss function

## Semiparametric estimation

- Hill's estimator and variants thereof
- Choosing the number of order statistics (table with different options)
- Computing quantiles using Weissman's estimator

## Threshold selection

- Some common diagnostics
- The cross-validation threshold model averaging
- Hill estimator type with 'rbm' package

## Regression models using 'evgam'

- Approaches to nonstationarity: Box-Cox transform, modelling residuals and generalized linear/additive modelling of parameters
- Standardize covariates for numerical stability
- Check goodness of fit using usual diagnostics (Q-Q plots)
- Careful with return levels (cautionary warning from Eastoe and Tawn with time-varying covariates)
- GAMs and overfitting: how to tell whether you are overfitting from the posterior distribution
- Using 'lax' to adjust for clustering in time series
- Bayesian paradigm and hierarchical models (an example using STAN or texmex?)
