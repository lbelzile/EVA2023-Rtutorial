## Nonstationarity

There are various forms of nonstationarity, including 

- trends, 
- time-varying variance,
- seasonality,  
- covariate effects.

No general theory

## Solution 1: preprocessing

- detrend data to approximate stationary.
   - for financial time series, fit ARMA-GARCH model
   - use Box-Cox transformation with regression model
- analyze residuals $R_i = Y_i - \widehat{f}(\mathbf{X}_i)$, where the postulated model is such that $\mathsf{E}(Y_i) = f(\mathbf{X}_i)$.

Benefit: more data to estimate trend

## Estimating probability of rare events

\begin{align*}
&\Pr(Y_i > y \mid \mathbf{X}_i) \\\quad &= \Pr\{R_i > y - \widehat{f}(\mathbf{X}_i)\mid \mathbf{X}_i\}
\\\quad & = \Pr\{R_i > y - \widehat{f}(\mathbf{X}_i)\mid \mathbf{X}_i, R_i > u\}\Pr(R_i > u) \\& \qquad + \Pr\{u  \leq R_i > y - \widehat{f}(\mathbf{X}_i)\mid \mathbf{X}_i\}\Pr(R_i \leq u)
\end{align*}
where the first term of the last line can be estimated using a generalized Pareto and the latter empirically (typically zero if $y$ is sufficiently large).

## Solution 2: hierarchical models

We can also incorporate parameters in the parameters of the extreme value distribution.

- Model $\mu=f_{\mu}(\mathbf{X}; \boldsymbol{\beta}_{\mu})$, $\sigma(\mathbf{X})=f_{\sigma}(\mathbf{X}; \boldsymbol{\beta}_{\sigma})$, etc.
- Typically keep shape constant.

For explanatories $\mathbf{X}$, fit regression models of the form
\begin{align*}
\mu(\mathbf{X}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mathrm{X}_1 + \cdots \beta_p \mathrm{X}_p,
\end{align*}
and estimate parameters by maximum likelihood.

## Generalized additive models

Rather than linear effects or changepoints (if $\mathrm{X}_j$ is binary), we could consider smooths

\begin{align*}
f(\mathrm{X}_j) = \sum_{k=1}^K \beta_k b_k(\mathbf{X}_j)
\end{align*}
where $b_k$ are basis functions, e.g., thin-plate splines (`tp`), cubic regression splines (`cr`) and their cyclic counterparts.

## Parsimony is key

- There are few exceedances or extremes...
- The support restriction translates into up to $n$ inequality constraints: difficult to optimize.


Take home message: keep models simple!

## Penalized regression

Penalization to enforce sparsity or regularize estimation.

- For generalized additive models (GAM), penalize square of second derivative to control the wiggliness of the function.
- Smooth matrix $\mathbf{S}$ with entries $S_{ij} = \int b_i''(x) b_j''(x)\mathrm{d} x$, so the penalty is
$\lambda \boldsymbol{\beta}^\top \mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{\beta}$ for $\lambda > 0$.
- These correspond to improper (i.e., rank-deficient) Gaussian priors.

## Tuning parameter

-  Optimal value of $\lambda$ selected by maximizing the marginal likelihood.
- With multiple spline smoothers, using Laplace's method for approximation [@Wood.Pya.Safken:2016].


## A word of caution

- With time-varying covariates, we need forecasts to compute risk measures in future.
- Model often fitted only at specific covariate values (careful at extrapolation beyond range).
- Rather than linear trend in time, use covariates that incorporate said trends but are more natural (e.g., climate model output).


## Return levels under nonstationarity

In nonstationary models, risk measures of interest are defined conditionally on the value of covariates

For example, the $1-p$ conditional return level is [@Eastoe.Tawn:2009]
\begin{align*}
\Pr(Y_t  > y \mid \mathbf{X}_t =\boldsymbol{x}_t) = p
\end{align*}

## Unconditional return levels

These can be obtained by averaging out over the distribution of covariates that are employed in the model.

\begin{align*}
\int_{\mathcal{X}} \Pr(Y_t  > y \mid \mathbf{X}_t =\boldsymbol{x}_t) \mathrm{d} P(\boldsymbol{x}_t),
\end{align*}

Return levels may be meaningless quantities.

May require information about future distribution of covariates if these are time-varying.

## Threshold stability

The generalized Pareto model with varying scale and shape is not threshold-stable unless, for any $v>u$, 
\begin{align*}
\sigma_v(\boldsymbol{x}_t) = \sigma_u(\boldsymbol{x}_t) + (v-u) \xi(\boldsymbol{x}_t)
\end{align*}

Restrictive! For constant $\xi$, need $\sigma$ linear or constant (log scale) [@Eastoe.Tawn:2009].

Using the inhomogeneous Poisson point process representation avoids these problems.

For nonstationary threshold models $u(\mathbf{X})$, see Section 3.2.2 of @Northrop.Jonathan:2011.

## Software

Function `evgam` from the eponymous package [@Youngman:2022] builds on the `mgcv` package [@Wood:2017:mgcv].

The setup is `evgam(formula, data, family, ...)`, where 

- `family` is the character string for the extreme value distribution (`gev`, `gpd`, `rlarg` and `ald` for asymmetric Laplace, used in quantile regression),
- `formula` is a list of formula for parameters (in the order location, scale, shape).

## Data setup
```{r}
#| label: evgam-setup
library(evgam)
data(frwind, package = "mev")
lyon <- with(frwind,
             xts::xts(x = S2, order.by = date))
ymax <- xts::apply.yearly(lyon, max)
years <- unique(lubridate::year(lyon))
```


## Example with `evgam`


```{r}
opt_gev_spl <- evgam::evgam(
  data = data.frame(
    syear = scale(years),
    ymax = ymax),
  formula = list(ymax ~ s(syear, k = 15, bs = "cr"),
                 ~ 1, 
                 ~ 1),
  family = "gev")
```

# `evgam` output

```{r}
## Summary with coefficients
summary(opt_gev_spl)
```

## Fitted splines 

```{r}
#| label: fig-splines
#| fig-cap: "Fitted spline for location parameter of GEV."
#| out-width: '60%'
plot(opt_gev_spl)
```

## Estimated quantiles

For given $p$, solve nonlinear equation $$\prod_{i=1}^n F^N(z; \boldsymbol{\theta}_i, \mathbf{X}_i) = p$$ using `qev` to give unconditional quantile.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false

evgam::qev(p = 0.368,
           m = 50, 
           loc = 0.9, c(1, 2), c(1, 1.1), .1, family="gev")
```
